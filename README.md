# Huffman-Tree-Encoding-Decoding
An implementation of huffman tree encoding and decoding schema using different data structures.

I have implemented binary heap, 4 way heap and pairing heap to find th best data structure for huffman tree encoding and decoding schema.

I found out that 4 way cache optimised heap is 30% faster than the other two.
